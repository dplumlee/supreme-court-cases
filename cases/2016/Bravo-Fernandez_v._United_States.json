In fact, Powell said that the most obvious explanation for that kind of inconsistency is that jurors were convinced of guilt and decided to acquit out of lenity. And it would be particularly inappropriate, I think, to accord preclusive effect to that kind of verdict based on lenity, because it would essentially magnify the effects of the jury's nullification and extend it far beyond the compromise the jury itself struck and affect other counts beyond what the jury ever intended.
