Now, with respect to worker's compensation, because it's an insurance scheme that is no fault, it operates in a very different way in terms of how it is funded. There's no pre-funding on the part of the railroad for FELA damages. The whole point of the FELA is to impose a duty of due care on the industry so that workers are not being injured as a result of the railroad's negligence. And that's why Justice Brandeis in the Winfield case in the early 1920s made very clear that an FELA judgment is a penalty for the breach of a duty of due care.

Now, if we prevail, whatever happens in terms of allocation on the taxing side, it is treated with parity on the benefits side.
