And FDA did express at that time the concern that practitioners, for whom that term usually connoted a relatively minor event, might read it as understating the seriousness of the potential health risk of Fosamax. That potential type of confusion needs to be distinguished from the question, was FDA confused by Merck's submission as a whole? And there's no reason to think that that was so.
