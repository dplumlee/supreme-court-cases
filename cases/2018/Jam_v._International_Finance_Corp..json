If I understand the other side's position correctly, basically, the question they're having -- they would want every federal court to ask in these cases is, what would the Truman Administration's State Department have wanted to do in this case? And when you have things like this, which didn't even -- an organization that didn't even exist at the time, sometimes doing activities that weren't even contemplated at the time, things like sovereign wealth funds, which foreign sovereigns now engage in, for example, who knows what the State Department would have thought then.
