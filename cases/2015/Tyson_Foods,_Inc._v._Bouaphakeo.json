The second way is that Dr. Fox did an analysis using Mericle's averages and then added them to the number of minutes worked by the particular employee, and so based on that, a vast number got above the 40-hour threshold. Now, the evidence at trial that it came in by Tyson's own witnesses was that the average worker worked 48 hours per week before you even got to any of the counting of the donning and doffing, and that the plant ran on Saturdays 60 percent of the time, which would be a 6-day work week.
