Private persons, jointly engaged with state officials in a challenged action, are acting \"under color\" of law for purposes of 1983 actions. And the judge's immunity from damages liability for an official act that was allegedly the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving bribery of the judge does not change the character of his action or that of his co-conspirators. Historically at common law, judicial immunity does not insulate from damages liability those private persons who corruptly conspire with a judge. Nor has the doctrine of judicial immunity been considered historically as excusing a judge from responding as a witness when his co-conspirators are sued, even though a charge of conspiracy and judicial corruption will be aired and decided.

The potential harm to the public from denying immunity to co-conspirators if the factfinder mistakenly upholds a charge of a corrupt conspiracy is outweighed by the benefits of providing a remedy [449 U.S. 24, 25]   against those private persons who participate in subverting the judicial process and in so doing inflict injury on other persons. pp. 27–32.", "SCOTUS": "1975–1981", "Majority": "White", "JoinMajority": "''unanimous''", "LawsApplied": ""}}
