The Court in Weiss went through the history of the military justice system in the court-martial side of the house and explained the role that military officers had long played in that system, and it concluded that, as a result of that role, serving as a judge on the court of criminal appeals is germane to holding military office.

And I think what that illustrates, and, by the way, I don't understand my friend to dispute that a judgeship on the court of criminal appeals is a military office, not a civil office of the sort that would be contemplated in Section 973. And what that shows is that even if an office can be held by civilians, as the court of criminal appeals judgeship can be, it is still a military office if it's performing a military function. So judged by that standard, we think Petitioners' claim fails on that first instance because the Court of Military Commission Review is not a civil office.

The analogy, of course, to this case would be to the underlying court-martial proceeding and not to the decisions by the courts of criminal appeals or by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Turning to the merits, I think it's important to stress the emptiness of the government's suggestion that it has been engaged in rigorous administrative enforcement of the statute. On its read-in of both Section 973(b)(5) and of the deletion of the automatic termination provision, there is, in fact, no consequence for violating a statute Congress enacted to ensure civilian control of the military, for protecting the civilians' fear of government from having military officers serving in all kinds of positions, and there would be no remedy, especially in a case like this one, where the problem at issue is not a general objection to military officers serving in administrative positions, but a very specific objection to military officers serving as judges. This Court has, for decades, suggested that there are unique separation of powers considerations and there are unique doctrinal and common law reasons to take especially seriously concerns that judges are acting without authority. It's why this Court in both the Ryder case and Nguyen held that the de facto officer doctrine does not apply to immunize at least non-technical violations of judicial assignment rules, and it's why the separation of powers problem we have identified is especially serious in this context. One last point, though, the -- neither -- the government doesn't talk about the -- did not talk about the Commander-in-Chief clause in its merits argument, but I think it's worth stressing just how serious a Commander-in-Chief clause problem a ruling in its favor could create.
