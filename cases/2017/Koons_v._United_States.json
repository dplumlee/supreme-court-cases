And the only difference between those people and -- and our clients in this case is that the guidelines measured their crimes as being more serious than the ones our clients committed.

And the reason why is because the judge adjusted the guideline sentences in our cases according to Subsection 5G1.1 and the Commission, as part of its amendments to 782 and the policy statements accompanying it, said when you calculate an amendment -- an amended guideline range, you do not include Section 5G1.1 as part of that calculation. So we have explained to the Court, and I don't think it's rebuttable, that even if you take the mistake the judge made in the first instance as a historical fact that the Court has to deal with, they still have lower guideline ranges under Section 3582.
